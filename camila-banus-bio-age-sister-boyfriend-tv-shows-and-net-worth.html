During this time she has made a net worth of <strong>500 thousand dollars.</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=camila-banus-quits></span><span><strong>Camila Banus Quits</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=camila-banus%e2%80%94her-days-of-our-lives-exit-interview></span>Camila Banus—Her Days of Our Lives Exit Interview<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><strong>What made you decide to leave?</strong></p><p>I’ve been on the show for three years. I was at the point where my contract was ending. I either needed to renew and stay or leave. I felt like it was necessary for me to go, to remove myself from Days…at least for a while. I don’t know what will be up with my life as far as a couple of years from now.</p><p><strong>What will you miss most about being on the show?</strong></p><p>The other day I was shooting and just having these little moments…like [sharing] a joke with the stage manager or getting to say hi to everybody in the morning. I feel like that’s what I’m going to miss because I’ve made a lot of great friendships—not only with the cast but with the crew. When you see these people day in and day out and then, all of a sudden, you don’t see them again…It’s going to be sad.</p><p><strong>One of the best turns for your character was her relationship with Nick. What are your thoughts on that?</strong></p><p>I love Gabi and Nick. A lot of Gabi’s happiness has come from the time she’s been with Nick. I appreciate that as somebody who’s playing Gabi because we’re in a soap opera where there isn’t a lot of happiness happening. The little bit we do have is fun when we’re playing it.</p><p>It’s nice when we play those moments, like Nick with the heart-shaped pillow [on the Valentine’s Day episode] or going out and getting yogurt or whatever little thing we might be doing. It’s those moments that are really fun. If the show was always hardcore drama it would be so negative and depressing all the time…a real Debbie Downer.</p><p><strong>What will you miss most about playing Gabi?</strong></p><p>Rafe and Gabi’s relationship. Somebody said the other day on Twitter that it was the best brother/sister relationship on any television show, which is awesome, and I agree. I think they’re amazing. [The writers] didn’t play them enough, but when they did, people always responded really positively toward them.</p><p><strong>Have you enjoyed working with your TV brother, Galen Gering?</strong></p><p>I really have. Galen is amazing. He’s just a great guy, and we have had so much fun working together. That’s one of the biggest things I’m going to miss the show—working with him.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=camila-bonus-interview></span><span><strong>Camila bonus Interview</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=interview-days-of-our-lives-star-camila-banus-knows-who-she-is-and-what-she-wants></span><strong>Interview: Days of our Lives star Camila Banus Knows Who She Is, and What She Wants</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><strong>What is it that motivates you to do what it is you do?</strong></p><p>Okay. I would say the main motivating factor in my life would have to be just the constant love for this particular craft and medium of entertainment. I pretty much became obsessed with the TV, or moving images, since I can remember and I’ve … my eyes … You know, I am a millennial, I come from that generation, but for me it was something.</p><p>The TV was like, a religion, you know, it was such a big deal that it changed my life completely. And it inspired me so much that that inspiration’s never left me; that love is never left me.</p><p><strong>What are you most passionate about in your career?</strong></p><p>I guess I would say I’m most passionate about two things. So, I have to say one thing is the craft itself. I personally love theatre history, and learning about dramaturge and playwrights, and, you know, everything that kind of was a foundation for what we create now. And I would say the other passion is, and this is gonna sound a little bit weird, but it’s kind of my own actions.</p><p>So basically, I feel like I have a style of acting that is my own and I feel like everybody has their own kind of thing. And I think one of the things that makes me really passionate about acting is that I love the way that I portray characters. I love that I am a little bit different. I’m not necessarily going for the stillness all the time.</p><p>You know, like, there are different types of people in this world. So for me, I’m very passionate about expressing a lot of different types of emotions and people.</p><p><strong>Do you ever like re-watch your scenes and critique yourself? Would you say that you are you’re the hardest critic?</strong></p><p>I don’t watch my scenes because if I do watch my scenes I start, like, really criticizing a lot of things, and I am my worst critic. Basically, I start doubting the decisions that I’ve made for my character because I start implementing what I think society wants to see as far as what is entertaining.</p><p>And, um, and so then like a lot of different things coming to my mind. Instead of just me actually watching the scene, I’m just thinking about how it could be better, or how I think all of a sudden it’s wrong, when before, not seeing it, I thought it was fine.</p><p><strong>Do you think doing that has better prepared you for when you do get on set, that you know like “I have my own things that I know I kind of need to work on” without being able to look at tape after?</strong></p><p>Yeah, I definitely think there should be a good, happy medium, as far as, like, there should be moments where you should be able to do your work and, and understand that you can grow from seeing your work and, you know, all of that. But I think there also is a level of comfort when you have confidence.</p><p>When you feel good about what you’re doing because, no matter what somebody says or whatever criticism, you know that it’s right and it’s something that feels good inside. There’s a level of, like, confidence when you walk into the set, and no one can tell you otherwise because it’s the character that you’ve created, and it feels right in your bones, you know?</p><p><strong>How many key mentors, or people who deeply influenced who you are, and what you believe in? Who inspired what you’re committed to in your work in life?</strong></p><p>One of the people that I identify a lot with is artist Salvador Dali. I think one of the reasons I identify with him so much is because he was able to, in his art, create so freely. There are no boundaries when it comes to surrealists or surrealism, and, so, to me, that’s one of the most beautiful mediums, is just being able to express however you want, without any judgments.</p><p>And so, he has been somebody that, his quotations, the way … things that he has said, you know. “I’m not”, “I’m not a madman. I don’t do drugs; I am drugs.”</p><p>All these things that are just like … he inspired so many different artists to be able to create without being censored. And so, for me, that’s somebody that I definitely emulate, and I have, I’ve always wanted to express in my craft and acting, freely, without censorship, without being judged, and it’s really hard because, in our industry, it’s about opinions.</p><p>It’s about “I like that; I don’t like that.” And so being able to like not to give a fuck sorry about me, my language. [Laughs]</p><p><strong>No, no, it’s awesome [laughs].</strong></p><p>But it’s really like not giving a fuck. And having artists, other artists like Michael Jackson, like Madonna, like Prince – these people that weren’t necessarily understood by everybody and still were committed to not giving a fuck. That everybody can understand them. You know, that, to me, is what makes them, them, and makes them so special and one-of-a-kind.</p><p><strong>Did it take you a while to get to this point where you’re able to not give a fuck about the outside things and be in your own zone?</strong></p><p>A little bit. I will tell you, I’m very blessed and very lucky that my mom was really …um, maybe she wasn’t as confident as I thought, but she definitely projected confidence to us.</p><p>And I had such an amazing example of what a strong, confident woman is, that at a really young age I was able to kind of mirror her and understand that, that, that there was no way that I was going to feel less-than, at least this that I’m seeing, which is a really confident strong woman, you know?</p><p>And I never saw less than that, and, so, yes, of course, life, and time, and just, you know, growth and age allows you to kind of not give a fuck, you know, more and more and more as you grow with age. But, I’ve kind of been like that a little bit my whole life.</p><p>You know, if I see an injustice, it’s really hard for me to just stay quiet. It’s really hard for me to stand up for somebody, even if it’s a stranger, just because I have something inside of me that kind of alerts me and doesn’t let me to not just, like, look away.</p><p><strong>As one of the few Latina women in the daytime, what are your thoughts on the importance of representation for women of color, and how Gabi plays into that as the only Latina character on Days of our Lives?</strong></p><p>I think with there’s a very big, um, degree of hype with the housewife. Um, the privileged housewife that gets to stay home, and not have to go to work, being one particular race. And I am so freaking honored to portray a Latina and to be viewed by so many different ethnicities and races that watch the show that isn’t just the ones that are the supposedly the privileged few.</p><p>Because let me tell you, there are so many people on social media, in person, of color that come up to me that appreciate that I have been pretty much full representation of the Latino culture on our show for the last ten years.</p><p>You know, for me it’s, it’s absolutely overwhelmingly exciting too, to be Gabi, to present her as somebody that is strong, doesn’t allow life to just passing by. She takes life and grabs it by the horns, and does what she wants with life. And so, to me, it’s been wonderful. See, I wish they could have more.</p><p>I wish we could see more other ethnicities, and other cultures, and other traditions, and things that people would not understand, but because they’re being exposed to it, they might be able to understand. So for me, it’s overwhelming. For me, it’s wonderful. For me it’s everything. But of course, I wish it could be more, always.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fmK6utcuaZJuZnqrAbq7IqGSan5ViwKq%2F056pZpqfrrOztcSnm2aspmLAqbvWrGSappRiu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fcamila-banus-bio-age-sister-boyfriend-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html&title=Camila%20Banus%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Sister%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20TV%20Shows%20and%20Net%20Worth." onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcamila-banus-bio-age-sister-boyfriend-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html&description=Camila%20Banus%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Sister%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20TV%20Shows%20and%20Net%20Worth." onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcamila-banus-bio-age-sister-boyfriend-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html&title=Camila%20Banus%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Sister%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20TV%20Shows%20and%20Net%20Worth." onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fcamila-banus-bio-age-sister-boyfriend-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html&title=Camila%20Banus%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Sister%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20TV%20Shows%20and%20Net%20Worth." onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fcamila-banus-bio-age-sister-boyfriend-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html&text=Camila%20Banus%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Sister%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20TV%20Shows%20and%20Net%20Worth." onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fcamila-banus-bio-age-sister-boyfriend-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Larita Shotwell</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-08-19</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./permanent-jewelry-bracelet-catbird-new-york-favorite-accessory-2023-8.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Permanent Jewelry From Catbird Is Still My Favorite Accessory</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./ben-harclerode.html><h3>Ben Harclerode >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
